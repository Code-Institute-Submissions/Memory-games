Resolve games is a website inspired by retro board games with the vision of bringing those much loved classics back up to date and onto your device. Not only will visitors be able to play these games, but also leave suggestions for more games they would like to see added.

The website has 3 main pages, 'Home'(the landing page), 'Simon Game' and 'Pairs Game', each of which contain a feedback section where visitors can leave there suggestions. Also, features and games are fully responsive meaning everything will still work on mobile devices.

- ### Design
    - #### Colour Scheme
        - The 2 primary colors I chose for my project was an off white (hex color #f7f7f7) and a strong blue (hex color #1c75bc). 
        From the beginning of the design process, my goal was to design a very clean, simplistic yet effective website with multiple
        interactive features that make for great user experience. ****//For example the navigation bar which collapses into a 'hamburger' menu
        on mobile and tablets for easier navigation through the site.///*** I picked these two colors as they really compliment each other and in 
        my opinion radiate cleanliness and simplicity. The psychological affects that the color scheme has on the user is instant and can literally
        dictate whether the user will continue to browse the site or leave.
            - [#f7f7f7](https://www.colorhexa.com/f7f7f7) (off-White): The off-white was used for the background color of the website. This is because,
            as opose to black, white is a reflective color which creates almost an invisible barrier to the user where they would sub-constiously beable
            to interact with the pages better as we are less likely to click on white compared to a more contrasting color. 
            - [#1c75bc](https://www.colorhexa.com/1c75bc) (Strong Blue): The strong blue color was used for all the titles/sub-titles, buttons and shadows.
            These contrasts realy well against off-white background and are eye-catching and 'stand-offish'. Strong blues stimulate clear thoughts and allow 
            for better reading.
        To conclude, the color scheme is implemented to create a clean, slick, professional look which allows for better user experience and increasing possibilities
        of that particular visitor to return again.
    - #### Typography
        - The Oswald font is the only externally imported font that was used throughout the entire website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case, for any 
        reason, the font isnt being imported to the site correctly. Oswald was used for all the headers, sub-headers and areas of key importance in order to
        maintain a professional look throughout and create clear distinction from the content text. This font was imported to the 'styles.css' from Google Fonts,
        where it is very easy to import from and are also a extremely reliable external source. The font is available in 6 different weights from 'Extra-light' (200 weight) 
        to 'Bold' (700 wight). Not only that, but they also provide a 'Variable weight axis' where you can set a custom font weight to import so you're not limited
        in any way. However, for this particular project, I kept to the base font weight as i thought that was the best match in this instance.
    - #### Imagery
        - Imagery was a big factor considered throughout the entirety of the development as it has such a powerful impact on users, which can be seen on instant
        execution of the landing page. I took extra measures when searching for images so they would maintain the correct aspect ration without having to alter
        them too drastically with hard code which can sometimes ruin the quality of an image. I also focussed on obtaining images which would best suit there
        place on the website and work well with the color scheme.

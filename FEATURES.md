## Features

    - ### Site Wide

    The site is made up of 3 pages, "Home"(the landing page), "Simon Game" and "Pairs Game".
    All pages have 3 main components in common. A navigation bar, suggestions form and a footer,
    all of which share the same basic structure in terms of layout. This especially apllies to the
    games pages which are laid out centrally and in the same position.

        - ##### The Navigation Bar
            - The navigation bar is fully responsive and is aesthetically pleasing on all platforms and devices. 
    
            - In desktop view (screen width size of 992px and above) the brand name is located at the far left hand side of the 
            navigation bar followed by the links to all the other pages and suggestion form placed far right.

            - In tablet view (screen width sizes between 992px to 767px) the logo remains over the left hand side however, the
            links are replaced by a 'hamburger' icon which stays over to the right. On click of this icon, there is a quick 
            animation and all the page links appear in column form over a suttle overlay. The overlay is slighty transparent so the
            user can still see the content, but dark enough so the links stand out and can be seen clearly. 

            - In mobile view & smaller screen sized devices (screen width sizes under 767px) the navigation bar acts the same way
            as described in the above 'tablet view'.

        - ##### Suggestion Form
            - The suggestion form can be located on any page of the site and is also referenced in the naviagtion bar. If the
            link is clicked from the navigation bar, the user will be automatically scrolled down to the form that is on that
            particular page. The form layout is compressed to reduce taking up un-necessary real-estate on the page but works
            really well with the flow of the site. The content is eye catching and draws users in.
            The buttons are the crown and glory of this form. There are two buttons, "Reset" and "Submit". I used a smart
            box-shadow effect on these which, when they are clicked, makes it seem like the button has been pressed. I also
            made it so that when the "Submit" button is clicked, the text changed from 'Submit' to 'Sent' which tells the user
            there form has been sent.

            - As the screen width size reduces into tablet view, the form stays wrapped and still allows for plenty of
            text input room. I chose to remove the 'Reset' button on this view as it creates more room for the 'Submit'
            button and allows everything to remain inline, while still being large enough for users to click.

            - In mobile view and smaller sized devices, the form displays vertically. The main reason for this is so
            the user has plenty of room to click on text boxes to fill out and not have the annoying issue of not being able
            to select a particular box (which I'm sure we've all experienced). Thus providing better user experience. 

        - ##### The Footer
            - The footer is fairly basic but still necessary. It contains the copyright information for the website which
            is against the strong blue background and is near to possible to miss

            - The footer is also fully responsive, however there are no changes as we go down the display sizes as it is
            not necessary.

    - ### Home Page (Landing Page)
